Notes
=======

This is intended to be a text file where I drop everything I've found during
the process of development of this emulator.

If you're looking for my notes on documentation about the CHIP-8 system or
anything like than then you should probably check the **docs/** directory.

TODO
-----

### Documentation
1. Add digit tables to doc/display.md


### Emulator
1. Everything

Diary
-------

### 4 NOV 2014
Started the project, created a git repo, pushed some boilerplate code.
I should probably check how can I integrate TDD into this project.
